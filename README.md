# CNN Drone BeFree

Temporary storage for my Master Thesis project for visual end-to-end control of drones.

I am working out on [this](https://github.com/idsia-robotics/proximity-quadrotor-learning) work from Dario Mantegazza, later expanded [here](https://github.com/FullMetalNicky/FrontNetPorting) by Nicky Zimmerman. The aims of the project is to make the drone flying outside of the room arena in which the dataset has been collected. For doing so, I am using network interpretability techniques together with background replacement/randomization on the dataset images.

- Some fast visual results are available in the `results` folder
