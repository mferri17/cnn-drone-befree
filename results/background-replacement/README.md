Here you can found some test I conducted on data augmentation.

- The folder `canny test min-max` contains some visualization of cv2.Canny() function min and max thresholds I used for selecting best values
- The document `09-30 Canny background replacement and training` inspects the Canny background replacement results both on dataset and network training
- The document `10-08 Human Detection and Segmentation` inspects other techniques for background replacement until [Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/akTwelve/Mask_RCNN) has been chosen
